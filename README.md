# GIVEAT 
*A smart bridge between surplus food and those who need it most*  

---

## ❗ Problem Statement  
Every day, **1 billion meals are wasted worldwide** while **783 million people go hungry**.  
In **Egypt**, more than **18 million tons** of food are wasted annually – a huge economic loss, an environmental burden, and a moral failure while many families still suffer from food insecurity.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  
**GIVEAT – The Smart Bridge** is a **two-sided mobile platform** that connects **food donors** with **charities and community groups**.  

- 🏢 **Donor Portal**: Businesses (restaurants, hotels, supermarkets) list surplus food.  
- 🤝 **Recipient Portal**: Charities discover and claim available food.  
- ⚡ **Smart Matching Algorithm**: Matches donations with the nearest recipients, reducing waste and ensuring quick delivery.
